    <p> Dorado, Watchpoint: Gibraltar, and Route 66 all have one thing in common. All three of these maps are pure "Escort" maps by gameplay standards. However, all three differ not just aesthetically, but in how they are designed. For the most part, each has the attacking team "escorting" a payload to a designated goal, while the defending team trying to halt the attacking team's efforts. Each payload is different in design and story-based significance.</p>
<p> Dorado, the setting of the short "Hero", takes place in a small mexican village celebrating the end of the Omnic Crisis. The attacking team spawns near the Missi√≥n Dorado, the lowest point in the map, where the player(s) can interact with large bells to create different musical pieces such as the Overwatch main theme. The defending team is placed randomly around the rest of the map including the attack goal ziggurat. </p>
<p> Watchpoint: Gibraltar, the setting of the short "Recall", takes place in an outpost overseen by Winston. The attacking team spawns in Winston's lab, with the goal being escorting a satellite drone to a rocket to launch it into space, where the drone will deploy and instantly contact and recall all inactive Overwatch members. The defending team spawns randomly around the outpost trying to stop the drone from being launched. </p>
<p> Route 66, the only "Escort" map on here to not be featured in an official Overwatch short, takes place along a desert road, where the attacking team's payload is a nuclear weapon. The nuclear weapon in question was the object of a heist planned by charcter McCree's old gang the Deadlock Gang. Before a patch to remove them, players could find easter egg photos of the characters Symmetra and Mercy in an outhouse.</p>
